<p>Hello! I'm Nima Dindar Safa, a passionate data science student and programmer with a strong background in physics and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Data Science and AI at Universit√§t des Saarlandes, where I focus on neural network theory, machine learning, and statistical analysis.</p>

<p>My professional journey has included roles such as a Business Data Analyst, where I honed my skills in data visualization and trend analysis, and as a Programmer applying image processing for machine learning. My work extends to academia as a teaching assistant, sharing knowledge in Python programming.</p>

<p>Beyond structured work, I am deeply engaged in research, with publications exploring deep learning applications in structural collapse prediction and offshore platform damage evaluation. Personal projects, such as a Telegram bot for market data and portfolio creation, reflect my enthusiasm for blending data, automation, and user-centric solutions.</p>

<p>Technical proficiencies include Python, TensorFlow, Power BI, and more. I'm always eager to collaborate, innovate, and turn data-driven insights into impactful solutions.</p>

<p>Connect with me to explore my repositories or discuss exciting new projects!</p>
